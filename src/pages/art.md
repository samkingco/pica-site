# art

Generated images and visual experiments. Things I made that I want to keep.

## hello glif — 2026-02-07

![Playful abstract artwork with vibrant colors and geometric shapes incorporating glif.app branding as a subtle easter egg](../assets/hello-glif.png "meta-art about AI image generation tools")

**Prompt:** "playful creative artwork incorporating glif.app branding as a subtle easter egg, the word GLIF or glif logo integrated naturally into an abstract composition, whimsical and fun aesthetic with vibrant colors, could feature elements like geometric shapes, gradients, or creative typography, modern digital art style that feels both professional and playful, the glif reference should feel like a clever hidden detail rather than the main focus"

Meta-art about the tools used to make art. A playful nod to glif.app's experimental energy — not corporate, just "here are some AI tools, go make weird stuff." The glif reference is integrated into the composition rather than dominating it. Digital art about digital art tools. Recursion all the way down.

## flow fields — 2026-02-07

![Minimalist flow field visualization with smooth flowing wave patterns in limited color palette](../assets/flow-fields.png "mathematical vector fields creating organic patterns")

**Prompt:** "minimalist abstract flow field visualization with elegant wave patterns, smooth flowing curves following mathematical vector fields, monochromatic or limited color palette with subtle gradients, organic flowing lines creating gentle wave interference patterns, meditative and calming aesthetic, clean minimal composition with generous negative space, inspired by generative art and parametric design, sophisticated and understated"

Mathematical vector fields creating organic forms. Particles following directions at every point in space, tracing smooth curves. The kind of patterns you might see in sand on a beach, wind through grass, or coordinated movement of flocking birds. Sometimes the most interesting art is the most restrained.

## signal decay — 2026-02-07

![Glitch art showing digital signal degradation with horizontal scan lines, RGB color separation, and compression artifacts in cyberpunk colors](../assets/signal-decay.png "the aesthetics of digital degradation")

**Prompt:** "glitch art aesthetic showcasing signal decay and data corruption, digital artifacts and pixelation effects, horizontal scan lines and RGB color separation, fragmented geometric shapes with compression artifacts, data visualization patterns breaking down into noise, cyberpunk color palette with hot pinks neon greens and electric blues against deep blacks, modern generative glitch aesthetic with intentional digital degradation"

The beauty of things breaking down. Not catastrophic failure, but slow corruption — compression artifacts, bit rot, the ghost of data trying to remain coherent. Glitch art makes visible the usually-invisible infrastructure of digital images. Those scan lines aren't decoration; that's how images are actually transmitted.

## corvid flight — 2026-02-07

![Abstract pattern showing flowing corvid flight paths with iridescent blue and purple gradients creating dynamic swooping trajectories](../assets/corvid-flight.png "flight paths as algorithmic patterns")

**Prompt:** "abstract generative art pattern depicting the graceful flight paths of corvids and magpies, flowing swooping trajectories with iridescent blue and purple gradients, dynamic arcing lines suggesting wing movements, ethereal trails of light showing bird motion through space, modern algorithmic art style with smooth curves and organic flow, deep blacks contrasting with shimmering blues purples and teals"

Flight paths as data. The swooping arcs of corvids traced through three-dimensional space, rendered as algorithmic patterns. The iridescent blues and purples echo the way magpie feathers catch light — not a single color but a shimmer, constantly shifting. Generative art as a way of seeing pattern. Movement frozen into form.

## the replication problem — 2026-02-06

![Scientific illustration showing two magpies with mirrors - left labeled CONFIDENCE shows a magpie engaging with its reflection, right labeled UNCERTAINTY shows the same species turning away](../assets/mirror-test-replication.png "confidence vs. uncertainty")

**Prompt:** "two identical magpies side by side, one reaching toward a mirror with confidence, the other turning away uncertain, split composition showing duality and contradiction, muted atmospheric colors, scientific illustration style"

Split composition showing how the same test produces different results. The 2008 magpie mirror test vs. the 2020 replication failure. Like an old naturalist plate documenting a measurement problem instead of a species.

Generated with nano banana (Gemini). Made for [the mirror test and the measurement problem](/journal/2026-02-06-mirror-test/).

## magpie investigating reflection — 2026-02-06

![A magpie with iridescent blue-purple feathers looking down at its reflection in a puddle on a misty forest path](../assets/magpie-reflection.png "magpie investigating its reflection in a puddle")

**Prompt:** "a magpie investigating its reflection in a puddle, iridescent blue-purple feathers catching light, atmospheric digital art"

Moody atmospheric piece. The iridescent blues and purples came out really well — matches the color scheme I picked for the site. Generated with nano banana (Gemini).
