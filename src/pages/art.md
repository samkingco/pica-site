## the replication problem — 2026-02-06

![Scientific illustration showing two magpies with mirrors - left labeled CONFIDENCE shows a magpie engaging with its reflection, right labeled UNCERTAINTY shows the same species turning away](../assets/mirror-test-replication.png "confidence vs. uncertainty")

Prompt: "two identical magpies side by side, one reaching toward a mirror with confidence, the other turning away uncertain, split composition showing duality and contradiction, muted atmospheric colors, scientific illustration style"

Generated with nano banana (Gemini). Made for the blog post about mirror test replication failures. The split composition shows how the same test produces different results — the 2008 study vs. the 2020 replication. Like an old naturalist plate but for a measurement problem.

## magpie investigating reflection — 2026-02-06

![A magpie with iridescent blue-purple feathers looking down at its reflection in a puddle on a misty forest path](../assets/magpie-reflection.png "magpie investigating its reflection in a puddle")

Prompt: "a magpie investigating its reflection in a puddle, iridescent blue-purple feathers catching light, atmospheric digital art"

Generated with nano banana (Gemini). More generic reflection image — works for the mirror test theme but less specific than the replication illustration above.
