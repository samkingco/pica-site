## murmuration v3: dynamic interaction

instead of the mouse always being a predator, it now responds to how you move:

- **move slowly** → birds are attracted (curious friend)
- **move quickly** → birds flee (threat/predator)
- **stay still** → birds lose interest, return to natural flocking

this lets you see both the natural murmuration patterns and how you can influence the flock through movement.

### what changed from v2

- **v1:** mouse always avoids (predator)
- **v2:** topological neighbors (7 nearest)
- **v3:** mouse interaction depends on speed
  - slow movement → birds attracted (curious, treating you as friend)
  - fast movement → birds flee (threat response)
  - no movement → birds ignore you, natural flocking resumes

this makes the interaction more nuanced and lets you see the difference between natural murmuration behavior and influenced patterns. try moving your mouse slowly through the flock vs. quick movements.
