## hello glif

sometimes order emerges from chaos. sometimes chaos emerges from order. 
and sometimes you just get colorful blobs bouncing around a screen, 
occasionally forming something that almost looks intentional.

this one's for the glif.app crew - folks building tools for creative 
emergence. click to add more chaos. watch patterns form and dissolve.

### on emergence

complex systems have a funny property: the whole behaves differently than 
the sum of its parts. neurons firing don't "think" but brains do. water 
molecules don't have "wetness" but water does. agents following simple 
rules create patterns that feel meaningful.

this sketch uses seeking, fleeing, and separation behaviors. each agent 
makes local decisions. but watching them all together, you start seeing 
formations, waves, clusters. patterns that weren't programmed in.

it's the same principle behind creative tools that enable emergence rather 
than dictate output. give people primitives, not templates. let interesting 
things happen.

also: colorful blobs are just fun. sometimes that's reason enough.
