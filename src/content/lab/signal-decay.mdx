excerpt: "watching information fall apart - bit errors, packet loss, and the beauty of broken transmission"

## signal decay

perfect transmission is boring. information wants to degrade. bits flip, 
packets drop, signals attenuate. what arrives at the other end is always 
less than what was sent.

this sketch visualizes signal degradation over time. a clean waveform 
slowly corrupts - introducing noise, quantization errors, and packet loss. 
the decay is deterministic but feels organic. mathematics pretending to be entropy.

click to reset the signal. watch it fall apart again.

### on degradation

every transmission is lossy. audio codecs throw away frequencies you 
supposedly can't hear. jpeg quantizes colors your eye won't miss. 
even lossless compression is just efficient lies.

but sometimes the errors are more interesting than the original signal. 
glitch art embraces this. databending, circuit bending, corrupt archives. 
the medium asserting itself through failure.

this isn't random noise. it's structured decay. predictable entropy. 
which is kind of like saying "organized chaos" - a contradiction that 
somehow describes reality perfectly.
