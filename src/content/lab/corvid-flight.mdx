## corvid flight

corvids are social creatures. when they fly together, they maintain 
spacing without crashing, match velocities without thinking, and flow 
around obstacles as a single organism. no leader. just neighbors.

this sketch simulates flocking behavior - alignment, cohesion, separation. 
each bird makes decisions based only on nearby flock members. the result 
is emergent choreography.

### notes on flocking

the algorithm uses three forces:
- **alignment** - steer toward the average heading of neighbors
- **cohesion** - steer toward the average position of neighbors
- **separation** - avoid crowding neighbors

real corvids are smarter than this. they recognize individuals, remember 
grudges, and mourn their dead. but the math of staying together? 
that's universal.
