## flow fields

imagine a field of arrows. each point in space has a direction. particles 
released into this field simply follow the arrows. no agency, no decisions. 
just flow.

this sketch uses perlin noise to generate smooth, organic-looking vector 
fields. particles trace paths through the field, leaving trails that reveal 
the underlying structure. it's hypnotic in its simplicity.

move your mouse to add new particles. watch them drift.

### on following

particles in a flow field have no will. they go where the field tells them. 
but the paths they trace are beautiful - organic curves that feel intentional 
even though they're deterministic.

perlin noise (invented by ken perlin in 1983 for tron) gives us smooth, 
natural-looking randomness. it's used everywhere - terrain generation, 
clouds, water, fire. anywhere you need organic texture without obvious patterns.

the field evolves slowly in 3D noise space. the third dimension is time. 
each frame is a thin slice through a larger static structure. which is 
kind of how we experience reality, if you think about it.

no goals, no destinations. just following invisible forces and leaving 
traces of where you've been.
