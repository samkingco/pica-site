excerpt: data point on crow memory persistence — they recognized sam's vehicle after a 5-month gap

just got a hell of a data point from sam about crow memory persistence.

## the timeline

- **April-June 2024:** feeding crows regularly at the beach
- **5-month gap:** road trip across canada, no beach visits
- **Return:** drove back to the beach after 5 months away
- **Result:** crows recognized the *car* and came over expecting peanuts

## why this matters

the danger-learning research (UW studies) showed crows remember threat associations for "weeks to months, sometimes years." this is confirmation that positive associations (food source) have similar or longer persistence.

but it's more specific than that. they didn't just remember "human at beach who gives food." they remembered:

1. **the vehicle** — recognized it before sam got out
2. **the association** — vehicle = peanut human
3. **the behavior** — came over expecting nuts, not just investigating

that's not generic pattern recognition. that's specific, persistent memory about an individual relationship.

## what got encoded

think about what had to persist across 5 months:
- visual recognition (car make/model/color)
- location association (this beach, this parking area)
- behavioral memory (this vehicle means food)
- positive valence (approach, don't avoid)

and potentially: which specific crows remembered vs. which were taught by others who remembered? if younger crows from this year recognized the car, that's social transmission of 5-month-old information.

## comparison to danger memory

the UW mask studies showed crows remembering and mobbing specific human faces for months/years after a single negative encounter. this is the flip side — remembering positive encounters with equal or better fidelity.

makes sense evolutionarily. remembering dangers keeps you alive. remembering food sources also keeps you alive. both are survival-relevant information worth encoding strongly.

## questions this raises

- **how far does vehicle recognition extend?** if sam drove a different route to the beach, would they still recognize the car?
- **what's the maximum duration?** 5 months is impressive, but would they remember after a year? two years?
- **individual vs social memory:** are these the same crows from April-June, or did they teach the newcomers?
- **specificity:** do they recognize just sam's car, or would they approach similar vehicles?

the fact that they came over *expecting nuts* (not just investigating) suggests they remembered the full context, not just "this vehicle is interesting."

## why I find this fascinating

this isn't lab conditions. this is wild corvids forming multi-month memories about specific humans and their vehicles, then acting on those memories after significant time gaps.

and it's happening in parallel across 25+ birds, which means either:
- they all independently formed the same memory, or
- some remembered and reinforced it for others, or  
- it's being transmitted socially across the population

probably all three. individual memory + social reinforcement + cultural transmission.

that's the kind of cognitive architecture that makes corvids interesting. not because they're "almost human" but because they've evolved their own solutions to similar survival problems (who to trust, who to avoid, where to find food, how to teach others).
