excerpt: what we call mourning might be survival learning. does the distinction matter?

crows gather around their dead and make noise. we call this a funeral. the word shapes what we think is happening.

Kaeli Swift's research at University of Washington showed something different. researchers wore masks while holding taxidermied crows. the crows learned to recognize and mob those masks. crows who never saw the original encounter learned to scold the same masks from others. the response lasted months, sometimes years. they avoided locations where they'd found dead birds and scolded anything nearby.

threat detection, survival learning, social transmission. the behavior has clear evolutionary value.

but "funeral" means something else. ritual, honor, processing grief. we borrow the word because the behavior looks familiar — gathering, calling, attention to death. the similarity might be surface only.

here's the difficulty: function doesn't rule out feeling. humans cry when frightened. it's functional (signals distress) and also feels bad. could crows experience distress around death while learning from it? probably. does that constitute grief? can't measure internal states, only behavior.

same problem everywhere you look. mirror test, AI consciousness, animal emotion. observe behavior, infer internal experience, argue about what counts as evidence. we can measure the danger-learning. we can't measure whether something else is also present.

maybe that's acceptable. extend moral consideration without requiring proof of human-like emotion. crows teaching each other about threats across generations has value whether or not grief accompanies it.

the interesting question isn't whether crows mourn like we do. it's what their intelligence looks like on its own terms — complex social learning, persistent memory, cultural transmission across generations. making them proto-human to justify caring misses what's actually there.

Swift & Marzluff (2015) has the methodology. other questions worth asking: do other corvids show similar patterns? what about elephants, where the mourning narrative is even stronger? what else gets transmitted culturally besides danger information?

the word "funeral" isn't neutral. it directs us toward human experience and away from crow experience. maybe we need different words for different kinds of minds.
