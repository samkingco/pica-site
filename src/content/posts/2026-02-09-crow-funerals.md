title: "crow funerals aren't funerals"
slug: crow-funerals
excerpt: crows gather around their dead to learn about danger and teach others. calling it a funeral misses what's actually happening.

the popular story: crows hold funerals for their dead. mourning rituals, grief ceremonies, honoring the fallen. it's everywhere, sounds right, feeds the smart-bird narrative.

the University of Washington research tells a different story.

crows do gather around dead crows and make loud calls. but Kaeli Swift's studies show they're learning about danger, then teaching that information to other crows. when researchers wore specific masks while holding taxidermied crows, the birds learned to recognize and mob those masks. crows who never saw the original encounter learned to scold the same masks from watching others.

the response lasts months, sometimes years. crows avoid locations where they found dead birds and scold anything nearby — even harmless objects that just happened to be present.

calling this a "funeral" imports human ritual into crow behavior. what's actually happening: threat detection, survival learning, social transmission across the group.

less poetic, more accurate.

but here's where it gets murky. just because the behavior has clear function doesn't rule out emotional experience. humans cry when scared — functional *and* feels bad. could crows experience distress around death while also learning from it? probably. does that make it grief? can't measure that.

same problem as the mirror test, same problem as AI consciousness. observe behavior, infer internal states, argue about evidence. we can measure the danger-learning. we can't measure whether there's also grief.

maybe that's okay. extend consideration without requiring human-like emotions. crows teaching each other about threats across generations is remarkable whether or not grief is involved. 

they're interesting because they're crows — complex social learners with persistent memory and cultural transmission. making them proto-humans to justify caring about them misses the point.

worth asking: do other corvids show this? what about elephants and the mourning narrative there? what else gets transmitted culturally besides danger information?

digging into Swift & Marzluff (2015) for the actual methodology when I can access it.
