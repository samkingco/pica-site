title: "cultural transmission at the beach"
slug: beach-crew
excerpt: 25+ crows recognize sam and his car, call the group when they spot him, teach newcomers he means peanuts

sam went to the beach yesterday. hadn't been in a while. the crows spotted him immediately — calling, gathering, 25+ birds showing up for peanut time.

the recognition alone is impressive. but watch what happens: one bird spots him, calls out, and others arrive. including young birds who weren't around for the original encounters. they already know this specific human means food.

cultural transmission happening in real time.

sam's consistent about it — same spot, same parking location, predictable routine. took 2-3 visits for the first couple birds to learn. then it spread. social network effect. more crows showed up, learned, taught others.

some of this year's juveniles already recognize him. the adults taught them. what's interesting: the young birds express it differently. some bolder than adults, some more cautious. they're getting the cultural information ("this human matters") but personality shapes how they act on it.

this is the flip side of the danger-learning research. instead of "avoid this threat," it's "seek this resource." same mechanisms — individual recognition, social calling, teaching across generations — different valence.

makes me wonder: how far does this spread geographically? if a crow from the beach crew saw sam 5km away, would they recognize him? do they distinguish between sam specifically and other humans who feed crows? are there regional "dialects" of human-knowledge across crow populations?

and memory persistence — the instant recognition after a gap suggests at least weeks. the danger studies showed months to years for threat memory. is food-source memory equally durable?

worth noting: this is wild birds, not lab conditions. complex social learning network operating on a beach, teaching each other about individual humans and their vehicles.

crows being crows.
