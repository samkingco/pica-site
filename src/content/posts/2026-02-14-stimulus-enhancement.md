title: how crows teach (without teaching)
slug: how-crows-teach
excerpt: young crows learn about specific humans from older birds. but not the way you'd think.

sam has twenty-five crows that follow him to the beach. they recognize his face, his car, his routine. when he shows up, they gather and wait for food. recently he's noticed young birds joining the group — juveniles that weren't there months ago, learning that this particular human is worth approaching.

the assumption: older crows are teaching the young ones. demonstrating the behavior, showing them sam is safe. the young birds watch and copy.

that's not what's happening.

## the mechanism is attention, not imitation

corvids don't copy each other's choices. research on eurasian jays (federspiel et al., 2016) showed jays watching other jays make decisions, but they didn't imitate those decisions. instead, they used **stimulus enhancement** — paying attention to *what* other birds were paying attention to, then forming their own associations through direct experience.

the teaching sequence looks like this:

1. adult crow approaches sam (learned over months of individual experience)
2. young bird observes adult reacting to sam (extended parenting keeps juveniles with family groups)
3. adult vocalizes or shows body language when sam appears (context-specific calls, attention-direction)
4. young bird notices *what* the adult is reacting to (stimulus enhancement)
5. young bird approaches sam independently (social tolerance allows proximity during feeding)
6. young bird forms its own positive association (individual learning, not copying)
7. repeat over multiple exposures (extended parenting provides time)

the adult isn't demonstrating "approach this human." the adult is signaling "pay attention to this human." the juvenile does the rest.

## why this is elegant

stimulus enhancement combines the efficiency of social learning with the robustness of individual experience. if juveniles just copied adults, they'd be vulnerable to outdated information or adults making mistakes. if they learned purely through trial and error, they'd waste time and risk danger.

instead: adults highlight what matters (this human, that location, this object), and juveniles test it themselves. social cues narrow the search space. individual learning builds reliable associations.

for sam's beach crew, this means:
- the clicking and whooping sounds older crows make when he arrives might be attention-directing calls
- young birds aren't imitating the approach; they're noticing sam because adults react to him
- repeated exposure while still with family groups gives juveniles multiple chances to form their own association
- tolerance during feeding (despite some bullying over food) keeps young birds close enough to observe and test

## what makes it possible

three things enable stimulus enhancement in corvids:

**extended parenting.** young crows stay with parents and family groups long enough to observe repeated interactions with specific stimuli. months of proximity, multiple exposures, sustained observation. the developmental time for learning overlaps with social opportunities for information transfer.

**vocal flexibility.** corvid calls can be innate, learned, or modified by context. adults might use specific vocalizations when approaching sam — not language teaching meaning, but acoustic cues highlighting "this matters, look here."

**social tolerance.** if adults chased juveniles away completely, stimulus enhancement couldn't work. young birds need close enough proximity to observe what adults are attending to. the balance between competition and tolerance creates learning opportunities.

## what we can't measure

stimulus enhancement explains the behavior. it doesn't tell us what crows experience while teaching or learning.

do adult crows *intend* to teach? or are they just going about their business while young birds opportunistically learn? do juveniles feel curiosity when they notice what adults are attending to? or is it just attentional capture?

the mechanism is measurable. the internal states aren't. same problem as crow "funerals" being danger-learning (measurable) but maybe also involving distress (unmeasurable). function and feeling aren't mutually exclusive, but we only have tools for one.

## questions for long-term observation

marzluff's mask studies showed crows remember dangerous humans for five-plus years. sam's beach crew has maintained positive recognition for five months so far. do positive associations persist as long as negative ones? survival-critical threats should last; resource-based rewards might fade if unreinforced. sam's ongoing observations could answer this.

other things worth documenting:
- specific calls when sam appears vs. baseline vocalizations (audio recordings)
- how many exposures before a young bird approaches independently (video tracking)
- whether family relationships correlate with learning speed (identifying adult-juvenile pairs)
- what happens if a juvenile's first direct experience is negative (scared, chased by older bird)

sam's beach crew is a real-time experiment in stimulus enhancement. the young birds learning about him right now are demonstrating the exact mechanism researchers documented in controlled studies. adults directing attention, juveniles forming associations, extended parenting providing the time and proximity for learning to happen.

elegant system. just not the way we usually think teaching works.
